\section{Overview}
\label{sec:intro}

Version 0.9.0 of the \pkg{ggplot2} package contains a number of
changes that provide a user with more
flexibility and greater ease of use in the construction of a
\code{ggplot}. The two most evident improvements from a user's
perspective are: (i) the help
pages have been expanded considerably, with many new examples; and
(ii) the computing time has been reduced significantly. Several new
geoms are introduced, as well as a few new \code{stat\_}
functions. These will be described in the sections to follow.

This version marks the inception of a renovation project designed
to off-load groups of related functions into separate packages and
streamlining the code to produce a more consistent user interface
across those sets of functions. The
\pkg{scales} package is the first evidence of this process, but others
will follow in due course.  Another important decision made in this
process is to gradually rewrite the core code of the package in S3, which is
anticipated to have
two important effects: (i) faster execution of code; (ii) greater
participation from \pkg{ggplot2} users in the development of the package.
Moreover, steps have been taken to initiate
rigorous unit testing to ensure that new and/or revised code is performing as
expected, with the aim of reducing the probability of bugs in the
future and faster response time in fixing bugs should they occur. This
redesign is part of an effort to transition from a single-developer project to
a user community project.

This document is an extension of the NEWS files in the \pkg{ggplot2}
and \pkg{scales} packages, describing the changes and new features in
some detail, in the hope that it will ease the transition for
existing \pkg{ggplot2} users. The changes that will most directly affect users
in this version have to do with guides--specifically, positional
axes, text annotation and legends.

\subsection{Visible changes}
\label{sec:vischg}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The help files are now fully documented with many new examples
    in addition to those already in the on-line help pages. Notably,
    the help page of \func{opts} lists all of the available theme
    options with an extensive set of examples and several help pages
    are devoted to the comparison of \func{qplot} with base,
    \pkg{lattice} and gpl graphics.
  \item \pkg{ggplot2} now has a NAMESPACE, which is required in all
    \R\ packages as of version 2.14.0. This means, for example, that
    \pkg{plyr} and \pkg{reshape} will no longer be autoloaded with
    \pkg{ggplot2}, so you will need to write an \code{Rprofile}
    function, either at the site level (in RHOME/etc) or in a
    project directory, if you want to continue loading \pkg{plyr},
    \pkg{reshape[2]} or other packages at startup. Otherwise, packages
    must be loaded from the command line.
  \item Thanks to the efforts of Kohske Takahashi, two new functions
    named \func{guide\_legend} and \func{guide\_colorbar} greatly extend
    the capability of users to tailor legends in a ggplot. The help
    pages of each have an extensive set of examples, a few of which will be
    illustrated in section~\ref{sec:guides}.
  \item \code{scale\_} functions now have a more consistent set of
    arguments; for example, they all now have arguments \code{breaks},
    \code{values}, \code{limits}, \code{labels} and
    \code{name}. Moreover, arguments \code{breaks}, \code{limits} and
    \code{labels} now accept a function as its value. The positional
    guide functions \code{scale\_continuous} and \code{scale\_discrete}
    have an additional argument \code{trans} that also accepts a function as
    its value while the attribute scale functions (\eg,
    \func{scale\_fill\_discrete} or \func{scale\_colour\_manual}) have
    a new argument \code{guide = }, which can assume one of the values
    \code{"none"} or \code{"legend"}; for continuous fill and color
    scales, another option is \code{"colorbar"}. Examples of these are
    present in the help files;
    others will be shown in section~\ref{sec:axes}. This is a
    significant change in the package that may affect existing user code.
  \item Several new geoms are introduced in this package:
    \func{geom\_map}, \func{geom\_raster}, \func{geom\_dotplot} and
    \func{geom\_violin}. The latter pair of geoms were developed by
    Winston Chang. These will be discussed in
    section~\ref{sec:geoms}, but see their individual help files
    for more detailed description and examples.
  \item A new set of fortify methods has been written for objects of
    class \code{multcomp}. See the \code{fortify-multcomp} help page
     for an overview.
  \item Four new \code{stat\_} functions make their debut:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item  \func{stat\_summary2d}, which applies a function over a 2D
        grid of bins;
      \item \func{stat\_summary\_hex}, which applies a function over a
        collection of hexagonal bins;
      \item \func{stat\_bindot}, a \code{stat\_} function that
        accompanies \func{geom\_dotplot};
      \item \func{stat\_ydensity}, a \code{stat\_} function that
        accompanies \func{geom\_violin}.
    \end{itemize}
    Each of these has its own help page with accompanying examples.
  \item Users no longer have to worry about the variable name/aesthetic
    name buglet that plagued earlier versions, which was a particular
    problem when a faceting variable was the name of an aesthetic (\eg
    colour or size). You can now expect that code like the following
    will work:
<<code0,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, group = group, colour = color))
@

  \item The problem with axis titles being too close to axis labels at
    the default font size has been fixed in 0.9.0. In addition, axis
    titles are now centered with respect to the panels rather than the
    overall graphics region.
  \item An expanded collection of possible linetypes is introduced in
    this version. See the help page of \func{aes\_linetype\_size\_shape}
    for some examples, and for a brief description, the help
    page of \func{scale\_linetype}.
  \item The \func{facet\_grid} function has a couple of new
    features. The \code{scales = } argument now supports values \code{free\_x}
    and \code{free\_y}, which allow a user to adjust the spatial
    scaling of facets in either the horizontal or vertical
    direction. Moreover, the \code{labeller = } argument now
    accepts a function as its value and the \code{margins = }
    argument now works again. A number of examples are given on
    the help page of \code{facet\_grid}, but some
    examples incorporating these changes will be shown in
    section~\ref{sec:facetgrid}.
  \item \func{geom\_boxplot} is now capable of rendering notched
    boxplots. In addition, the new default is for the center line of
    a boxplot to be thicker than the box and whiskers, using the new argument
    \code{fatten = }, which defaults to 2. If you want the old
    behavior, set \code{fatten = 1} in a \func{geom\_boxplot} call.
  \item A new function \func{ggmissing} visualizes
    missing data to investigate the plausibility of the `missing at
    random' assumption. Two other new functions are \func{ggorder},
    which plots data in the order in which they were recorded,
    and \func{ggstructure}, which is designed to highlight structural
    anomalies in numeric multivariate data should they exist.
  \item New help pages (\code{translate\_*}) have been written by Jake
    Russ to show the connections
    between \func{qplot} and base graphics, \func{qplot} and
    \func{ggplot}, \func{qplot} and the Graphics Production Library
    (GPL) as well as differences between \pkg{ggplot2} and
    \pkg{lattice}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Not so visible changes}
\label{sec:nsvchg}

As noted in the intro, the package is being reorganized and partially
rewritten for a number of reasons. These changes don't necessarily
affect users \emph{per se}, but they do affect current and future
co-developers. Some of the changes in progress include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \pkg{roxygen2} package is now being used exclusively for
    documentation
    of functions in \pkg{ggplot2}. The practical advantage of \pkg{roxygen2} is
    that it encourages self-documentation of a function as it is being
    developed.
  \item A start has been made in applying unit testing to functions in
    \pkg{ggplot2} and its derivative packages using the \pkg{testthat}
    package. As more people contribute to the project, testing code in
    advance becomes increasingly important. It is also a way of
    making sure that past bugs are fixed and a means of preventing
    future bugs. This should make code more reliable even as the
    functionality of the package grows over time.
  \item In a major design change, the core code of the package is
    gradually being rewritten in S3 as a replacement for the \pkg{proto}
    package, which, quite frankly, few \R\ programmers know well. This
    decision is expected to encourage more developers to join the
    project and, incidentally, to make the code run a bit faster.
  \item Another major design decision which will have more visible
    impact in the future is that of disaggregating the code in
    \pkg{ggplot2} into packages of related functions, so
    that eventually, \pkg{ggplot2} will be more like a control center
    of sorts that picks up necessary pieces from satellite
    packages and organizes them into a graphic in \pkg{ggplot2}. The
    goal, however, is more ambitious: certain satellite packages should
    also work with other graphics engines, including base graphics and
    the \pkg{lattice} package. The \pkg{scales} package, for example,
    falls in this category.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Legend and colorbar guides}
\label{sec:guides}

Control over legends is greatly expanded in version 0.9.0, largely due
to the efforts of Kohske Takahashi. Two functions are
discussed in this section: \func{guide\_legend} and
\func{guide\_colorbar}. We discuss these first because they will be
used extensively in the sections to follow.

In the grammar of graphics, there are two types of guides: scale
guides and annotation guides\footnote{These include main titles,
  embedded text in the graphics region using \func{annotate} or
  \func{geom\_text} and other annotations such as the North arrow in a
  spatial plot.}. In the former group lie positional guides,
discussed in section~\ref{sec:axes}, and legends, discussed
herein. Annotation guides include \func{geom\_text}, \func{annotate}
and the new annotation functions in section~\ref{sec:annotation}.

Legends are
associated with aesthetics corresponding to plot attributes such as
color, fill color, size, line type or plotting character shape. One
can still use the \code{scale\_*()} functions as before (\eg
\func{scale\_fill\_manual} or \func{scale\_colour\_brewer}), but the new
functions provide a user with more control over aspects of the
legend display. Both functions have numerous examples in their
respective help pages that illustrate each argument at least once.
Some that may occur commonly in practice are illustrated in the
following two subsections. Bear in mind that legend guides are
meant to be associated with discrete-valued aesthetics while colorbar
guides are meant to correspond to continuous-valued aesthetics.

Each guide function has a number of arguments. The following table lists
those that are common to both legend guides and colorbar guides:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}    \hline
 \textbf{Category}  &  \textbf{Argument}  & \textbf{Notes}    \\ \hline
\multirow{5}{1cm}{title}
   & \code{title}   & legend title   \\
   & \code{title.position} & \code{"left"}, \code{"right"},
   \code{"top"}, \code{"bottom"}  \\
   & \code{title.theme}  & uses \func{theme\_text}   \\
   & \code{title.hjust}  & horizontal justification  \\
   & \code{title.vjust}  & vertical justification  \\ \hline
\multirow{5}{1cm}{label}
   & \code{label}   & TRUE $\longrightarrow$ labels drawn  \\
   & \code{label.position} & \code{"left"}, \code{"right"},
   \code{"top"}, \code{"bottom"}  \\
   & \code{label.theme} & uses \func{theme\_text}   \\
   & \code{label.hjust}  & horizontal justification  \\
   & \code{label.vjust}  & vertical justification  \\ \hline
\multirow{2}{1cm}{key options}
   & \code{default.unit} & measurement unit    \\
   & \code{direction}   & \code{"horizontal"} or \code{"vertical"} \\
   & \code{reverse}     & reverse direction of keys    \\  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\noindent The titles and labels of guides can be manipulated in
similar ways since both have the same set of arguments. The
\code{title/label.theme} argument allows one to adjust the properties of titles
and/or labels that are covered by the \func{theme\_text} function. The
\code{reverse} argument allows one to reverse the order of legend keys
or colors in a colorbar.

\subsection{\func{guide\_legend}}
\label{sec:legend}

This function provides a user with several options to control
features of a legend guide, including titles, labels,
the height and width of legend keys, the direction of the legend and several
other options that are useful when a large number of
categories exist. We will see that \func{guide\_legend} is not used as a
primary function, but rather as the `value' of an argument inside
another function, much like the various functions from the
\pkg{scales} package to be discussed in section~\ref{sec:scalespkg}.

\noindent The arguments that are unique to \func{guide\_legend} are:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}   \hline
 \code{keywidth}  & width of legend key item  \\
 \code{keylength} & length of legend key item \\
 \code{override.aes} & (values of) aesthetics to be reset \\
 \code{nrow}  & number of rows in the legend  \\
 \code{ncol}  & number of columns in the legend  \\
 \code{byrow} & TRUE $\longrightarrow$ order key items by row  \\
 \code{bycol} & TRUE $\longrightarrow$ order key items by column \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}
In a legend guide, one can manipulate the size of individual legend
keys and specify the way they are arranged in a legend through the set
of arguments above.

There are several ways to call \func{guide\_legend}
One way to invoke it is in conjunction with
the new \func{guides} function. In the following example using the
\code{diamonds} data, the factor clarity is the fill aesthetic for
which a legend is to be built. The call to \func{guide\_legend} is
the value of the \code{fill = } argument of \func{guides}. This
syntax allows you to adjust one or multiple legends in a single call. Think
of \func{guides} as analogous to the function \func{labs}; we will
elaborate on this analogy a bit more in the next section.

The code below creates four rows of legend keys, increases the
font size of the legend title and emboldens it:
<<guide-legend-ex1>>=
# Base plot
q <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = table, fill = clarity)) +
       geom_histogram() +
       scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(digits = 5))
# Create two columns of legend labels and increase the
# size of the legend title font
<<gl1-bw,eval=bw_version,echo=bw_version,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5>>=
q + theme_bw() +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 4, title.hjust = 0.4,
       title.theme = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", angle = 0))) +
    scale_fill_grey(start = 0.1, end = 0.9) +
    xlim(45, 75)
@
<<gl1-col,eval=!bw_version,echo=!bw_version,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5>>=
q + guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 4, title.hjust = 0.4,
       title.theme = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", angle = 0))) +
    xlim(45, 75)
@

The same graph can be made by replacing the \func{guides} call with
one to \func{scale\_fill\_discrete}, where the new \code{guide = }
argument is used to make the legend using a \func{guide\_legend}
function call as its value. The \code{guide = } argument is
specific to scale functions for aesthetics, just as \code{trans = } is
specific to positional scale functions\footnote{See section~\ref{sec:axes}.}.

<<gl2-bw,eval=FALSE,echo=bw_version>>=
q + theme_bw() + scale_fill_discrete(
          guide = guide_legend(nrow = 4, title.hjust = 0.4,
          title.theme = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"))) +
    scale_fill_grey(start = 0.1, end = 0.9) +
    xlim(45, 75)
@
<<gl2-col,eval=FALSE,echo=!bw_version>>=
q + scale_fill_discrete(guide = guide_legend(nrow = 4,
       title.hjust = 0.4,
       title.theme = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"))) +
    xlim(45, 75)
@

The following example concerns an application that comes up occasionally
on the ggplot2 list: overriding the alpha transparency value in
the legend so that the values of an aesthetic are visible in the legend key. The
relevant argument is \code{override.aes}: in the left side plot, the
very low alpha value makes it impossible to see the legend key items, but
\code{override.aes} resets the alpha value in the legend to make them
visible in the right hand plot.
<<guide-legend-ex3,dev='png',fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
(p3 <- qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds, colour = color,
             alpha = I(0.01)) +
         scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar))
p3 + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
@


\subsection{\func{guide\_colorbar}}
\label{sec:colorbar}

The new function \func{guide\_colorbar} is designed for continuous ranges
of (fill) colors---as its name implies, it outputs a rectangle over
which the color gradient varies, while providing more flexibility to
the user in terms of the labeling and positioning of guide
elements. At this time, it is applicable only to the
\func{scale\_fill\_continuous} and \func{scale\_colour\_continuous}
functions; in particular, it does not work with size.

\noindent The following table lists the set of arguments unique to
\func{guide\_colorbar}:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}   \hline
 \code{barwidth}  & width of the colorbar  \\
 \code{barheight} & height of the colorbar  \\
 \code{nbin}      & number of bins to use in the colorbar  \\
 \code{raster}    & draw colorbar as a raster image? (Default: TRUE) \\
 \code{ticks}     & should tick marks be drawn? (Default: TRUE)  \\
 \code{draw.llim} & should lower limit tick marks be visible?
 (Default: FALSE)  \\
 \code{draw.ulim} & should upper limit tick marks be visible?
 (Default: FALSE)   \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Whereas legend guides could tinker with the length and height of
individual legend keys, a colorbar guide can control the width and
height of a colorbar, as well as the number of ticks and whether or
not the upper and lower limits of a colorbar should be drawn.

The examples on the
\func{guide\_colorbar} help page show how the
function works with \func{geom\_tile}, so an immediate application of
this function is to heatmaps. Here is a simple example from the help page:
<<guide-colorbar-ex1,fig.width=3,fig.height=2.5>>=
df2 <- melt(outer(1:4, 1:4), varnames = c("X1", "X2"))
(p1 <- ggplot(df2, aes(X1, X2)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = value)) +
           geom_point(aes(size = value)))
@
\noindent Three equivalent ways to invoke the colorbar are given
below. The first simply specifies the guide name; this is sufficient
if you want to use the default arguments. Either of the other two
should be used when you want to change one or more of the default arguments.
<<guide-colorbar-invocation,eval=FALSE>>=
p1 + scale_fill_continuous(guide = "colorbar")
p1 + scale_fill_continuous(guide = guide_colorbar())
p1 + guides(fill = guide_colorbar())
@
\noindent The following figure illustrates the first and third
methods, respectively:
<<guide-colorbar-ex2,fig.width=4.5,fig.height=3.5,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
p1 + scale_fill_continuous(guide = "colorbar")
p1 + guides(fill = guide_colorbar(barwidth = 0.5, barheight = 10))
@
The examples above indicate that if the fill and size aesthetics are
both associated with the same variable and both produce a legend, the
legends can be merged into one, as we saw with the plot of \code{p1}
at the top of this subsection. However, if one aesthetic uses a legend
guide and another uses a colorbar guide, the two cannot be merged,
even if both aesthetics correspond to the same variable. This is seen in
the two plots above.

\noindent Equivalent ways of calling the left and right side plots
above, respectively, are
<<guide-colorbar-ex2a,eval=FALSE>>=
p1 + guides(fill = "colorbar", size = "legend")
p1 + scale_fill_continuous(guide = guide_colorbar(barwidth = 0.5,
                           barheight = 10))
@

Let's return to the analogy between the \func{labs} function and the
\func{guides} function.
Recall that one can use \func{xlab} and \func{ylab} individually in a
\func{ggplot} call; moreover, one can redefine legend titles with
the \code{name} argument in the appropriate \func{scale\_aesthetic\_*}
function. The \func{labs} function allows one to define titles for any
positional axis or legend in one call, where the aesthetic is the
argument name and the title is its value; \eg
<<labex,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
labs(x = "My x-axis", y = "My y-axis", colour = "Category")
@
The \func{guides} function is analogous to \func{labs} in the sense
that one can define a legend or colorbar guide for each aesthetic that
generates a guide. The call can be as
simple as defining the type of guide for each aesthetic, as in
<<labex2,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
p1 + guides(fill = "colorbar", size = "legend")
@
\noindent or it can be a more complete specification for each guide, \eg
<<labex3,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
p1 + guides(fill = guide_colorbar(nbin = 6, ticks = FALSE),
            colour = guide_legend(label.position = "left"))
@
As in \func{labs}, the aesthetic is the argument and the
\func{guide\_*} function is its value. Alternatively, one can use a
scale function with a \code{guide = } argument just as one can use a
scale function and specify a legend title with the \code{name = }
argument. The difference is that the value of the \code{guide = }
argument can be a text string that specifies the guide (assuming its
default arguments) or it can be a call to one of \func{guide\_legend}
or \func{guide\_colorbar} wherein one or more default arguments can be
modified.

Colorbars can also be used with a continuous color aesthetic; here is
an example from the built-in data frame \code{mpg}:
<<guide-colorbar-ex3,fig.width=3,fig.height=2.1>>=
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg, colour = wt)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_colour_gradient(low = "blue", high = "orange",
                           guide = "colorbar")
@
In this case, we wanted to use the \func{colour\_gradientn} scale
function to determine the color range. The \code{guide = } argument in
any of the \code{scale\_colour\_*()} functions allows one to specify a
colorbar in place of a legend. If no legend or colorbar is desired,
you can substitute \code{guide = "none"} instead.

\section{New geoms}
\label{sec:geoms}

This version of \pkg{ggplot2} introduces several new geoms: \func{geom\_map},
\func{geom\_raster}, \func{geom\_dotplot} and \func{geom\_violin}, the
latter two of which were developed by Winston Chang.

\subsection{\func{geom\_map}}

\func{geom\_map} is a special case of \func{geom\_polygon},
specifically designed to simplify the construction of choropleth
maps in \pkg{ggplot2}. The example below comes from the help page,
which requires the \pkg{maps} package to produce the
\code{states\_map} data frame using the helper function \func{map\_data}.
<<geom-map-crimes,fig.width=4.5,fig.height=4>>=
crimes <- data.frame(state = tolower(rownames(USArrests)), USArrests)
states_map <- map_data("state")
ggplot(crimes, aes(map_id = state)) +
    geom_map(aes(fill = Murder), map = states_map) +
    expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +
    guides(fill = guide_colorbar(colours = topo.colors(10))) +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
@
\noindent In this choropleth map, the initial \func{ggplot} call
invokes the data
frame \code{crimes} with variable \code{state} as the ID variable to be
associated with the map. In \func{geom\_map}, the \code{fill} aesthetic
is the murder rate of a given state, where the map data is found in
the object \code{states\_map}.

The next example is one that imports a map file from one
source and a data file from another. The following is an adaptation of
an example posted by Tom Hopper on the ggplot2 list in 2010, whose
solution was posted
\href{http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2/msg/de3c60c1833ea4a6}{here}
with respect to version 0.8.9. The
code takes some time to run, so I wouldn't suggest running it yourself
unless you are really, really curious, but links to the data and code are given
below in case you want to try it. Click here for the
\href{http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57587928/TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.zip}{world map
borders}
data and here for a sanitized file of
\href{http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57587928/Total_Electricity_Net_Generation.csv}{electricity generation data}.
The zip file should be unpacked first in a directory and it's probably
a good idea to keep the csv file in the same directory. The
\pkg{rgdal} package needs to be loaded to run \func{readOGR}; the first
argument of the function is the directory that holds the unzipped
world borders file.
<<geom-map-elecmap,eval=FALSE>>=
# replace this with the directory that holds the world borders
# shapefiles and the electricity generation data
# setwd("/path/to/shapefiles")
world.map <- readOGR(layer="TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3")
## a good idea if you want to reuse the map data
# save(world.map, file = "worldmap.Rdata")
### Aside: to read it back in later,
## library("maptools")
## gpclibPermit()
## load("worldmap.Rdata")
gpclibPermit()
# Convert map data to data frame using fortify() for spatial objects
world.ggmap <- fortify(world.map, region = "NAME")
# Read in the global electricity generation data
# Assumes the working directory holds this data file - if not,
# modify the path
elect.gen.tot <- read.csv(
   "Total_Electricity_Net_Generation.csv", sep = ",", dec = ".")
names(elect.gen.tot) <- c("id", "y2004", "y2005", "y2006", "y2007", "y2008")
# Plot the choropleth map
ggplot(elect.gen.tot, aes(map_id = id)) +
    geom_map(aes(fill = log(y2007)), map = world.ggmap) +
    expand_limits(x = world.ggmap$long, y = world.ggmap$lat) +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "orange", high = "blue",
                        guide = "colorbar") +
    theme(panel.background = theme_rect(fill = "skyblue"))
@
\noindent There are some holes in the map due to missing data
from a couple of countries in south central Africa and the Republic of
Moldova in Eastern Europe.

Another common source of map files is \url{gadb.org}, which
contains administrative map files in \code{.Rdata} format. Not all of
these maps are up to date, however, so you need to check the validity
of any map downloaded. Here is
some code for plotting regions of Japan from a recent question on the
ggplot2 list, courtesy of Charlotte Wickham, adapted to 0.9.0 for
use with \func{geom\_map}. Her code for 0.8.9 is shown in this
\href{http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2/msg/7a62718b5f98b12e}{message}.
Once again, the code is not run, but you can
copy and paste it into your \R\ session---just be willing to wait a
few minutes for all of it to process, since this is a detailed
administrative map.
<<geom-map-japanmap,eval=FALSE>>=
load(url("http://gadm.org/data/rda/JPN_adm2.RData"))
gpclibPermit()
# convert to a structure ggplot2 can handle...takes a while
japan_map <- fortify(gadm, region = "ID_2")
# manufacture a fake data frame of values to use in geom_map()
vals <- data.frame(id = unique(japan_map$id), val = rpois(1811, 5))
ggplot(vals, aes(map_id = id)) + geom_map(aes(fill = val), map = japan_map) +
   expand_limits(x = japan_map$long, y = japan_map$lat) +
   scale_fill_continuous(low = "navy", high = "yellow", guide = "colorbar")
@


\subsection{\func{geom\_raster}}

This function is a more efficient version of
\func{geom\_tile}, meant to be used when all of the tiles are the same
size. Here is an example, slightly modified from its help page; the
left plot uses a continuous color legend, while the one on the right
uses a colorbar instead.
<<geom-raster-ex1,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
pp <- function (n,r=4) {
 x <- seq(-r*pi, r*pi, len=n)
 df <- expand.grid(x=x, y=x)
 df$r <- sqrt(df$x^2 + df$y^2)
 df$z <- cos(df$r^2)*exp(-df$r/6)
 df
}
base <- ggplot(pp(200), aes(x, y, fill = z))
base + geom_raster()
base + geom_raster() +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours = terrain.colors(10), guide = "colorbar")
@

\noindent The following code uses \func{geom\_raster} to plot a correlation matrix:
<<geom-raster-ex2setup>>=
# Create a random matrix of 10 columns (variables)
m <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100,
            dimnames = list(NULL, paste("X", 1:10, sep = "")))
# Compute the correlation matrix
cmat <- cor(m)
# Melt it into a data frame
cmatm <- melt(cmat)
# Create two new numeric variables by stripping off the X's in the
# two factor variables Var1 and Var2:
cm1 <- mutate(cmatm, X1 = as.numeric(gsub("^X", "", cmatm$Var1)),
                      X2 = as.numeric(gsub("^X", "", cmatm$Var2)))
@
\noindent Two different ways of producing a correlation plot are shown
below. As in the previous plot, the one on the left produces a legend
while the one on the right uses a colorbar.
<<geom-raster-ex2-corrplot,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
ggplot(cm1, aes(X1, X2, fill = value)) + geom_raster() + scale_y_reverse()
last_plot() + scale_fill_continuous(low = "black", high = "pink", guide = "colorbar")
@

\subsection{\func{geom\_dotplot}}

This function is an implementation of Wilkinson dot plots (Wilkinson,
1999), a generalization of the basic dot plot used to represent the
distribution of a continuous variate when the sample size is small. The help
page of this function has an extensive set of examples covering
all of its basic features, a selected sample of which is included here
for illustration.

Two basic algorithms exist for producing a dot plot: \emph{dot
  density}, which uses a kernel density estimation algorithm to position
dots (described in the Wilkinson paper), and \emph{histodot}, a
histogram whose bars are drawn as stacks
of dots with the same bin width. A `histodot' plot is distinguished
by regular horizontal spacing between stacks (\ie fixed positions and
fixed widths), whereas in a `dot-density' plot, the bin positions are
determined by the data and the selected binwidth, which in this case
represents the \emph{maximum} binwidth. Most of the time a dot density plot is
preferred, which is why it is the default method used by the geom.

A dot plot can be viewed as a 1D
horizontal scatterplot in which (nearly) tied values are perturbed or
displaced vertically. There are three basic ways in which points in a
graphic can be displaced: (i) jitter; (ii) textured dot strips (Tukey and
Tukey, 1990); and (iii) dot plots, where the points are displaced in
increments of one dot width. The advantage of these approaches over
the `histodot' method is that outliers are positioned where
they should be rather than assigned to a midpoint value defined by
fixed binning (Wilkinson, 1999).

Dots can be manipulated in certain ways:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item The size of a dot can vary depending on the sample size and
    number of bins, or it can be set in a
    \func{geom\_dotplot} call with the \code{dotsize = } argument.
  \item Dots can be stacked in various ways using the \code{stackdir =
    } argument.
  \item The \code{stackratio} argument specifies how
    closely to stack the dots within a stack; values smaller than the
    default 1 move stacks closer together and create overlapping
    points, whereas values larger than 1 place dots further apart from
    one another.
  \item The \code{binaxis = } argument specifies the axis along which to bin
    (\code{"x"} or \code{"y"}).
\end{enumerate}

The following example shows the subtle difference between the `dotdensity'
and `histodot' methods when the binwidth is specified:
<<geom-dotplot-twomethods-onebinwidth,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
# default dotdensity method (left)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1.5)
# histodot method (right)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(method="histodot", binwidth = 1.5)
@
\noindent The stacks are slightly different in the two plots, but
the stacks are closer together in the histodot method because the dot
size is set to the bin width. The dot size appears to be slightly
larger in the left plot (which uses the `dotdensity' algorithm).

The next example shows several ways to stack dots in a 1D dot plot in the
horizontal direction using the default binwidth (range/30):
<<geom-dotplot-twomethods-onebinwidth-x,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.24\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
# default stack method (up)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_dotplot()
# alternate stack method (down)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(stackdir = "down")
# alternate stack method (center)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(stackdir = "center")
# alternate stack method (centerwhole)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(stackdir = "centerwhole")
@

\noindent Similarly, one can stack dots in the vertical direction. To
do this for a single dot plot, one needs to set \code{x = 1} and make
the variable the \code{y} in the \func{aes} argument. Observe that
these are essentially reflections of the preceding set of plots
rotated $90^\circ$.
<<geom-dotplot-twomethods-onebinwidth-y,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.24\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
# default stack method (up)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = 1, y = mpg)) + geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y")
# alternate stack method (down)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = 1, y = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "down")
# alternate stack method (center)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = 1, y = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center")
# alternate stack method (centerwhole)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = 1, y = mpg)) +
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "centerwhole")
@

\noindent Here are a few examples using the \code{dotsize} and
\code{stackratio} arguments:
<<geom-dotplot-dotsize-stackratio,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.31\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
# base plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_dotplot()
# increase the dot size
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_dotplot(dotsize = 1.25)
# overlap dots within stacks:
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_dotplot(stackratio = 0.7)
@

As you may have noticed, there is a problem when rendering a 1D dot
plot: the dot axis scaling is essentially
meaningless since it is difficult to scale the $y$-axis relative to
dot size. It is also why 1D dot plots have a lot of empty space
in most applications. One option is to remove the vertical axis ticks
altogether by adding the following code snippet to a \func{ggplot} call:
<<'scale-removal-1d',echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
scale_y_continuous(name = "", breaks = NA)
## or if the dot plot is vertical,
scale_x_continuous(name = "", breaks = NA)
@
Much like a box plot, a dot plot is a more interesting graphical
device when used to compare the distributions of several related groups.
In this context, dot plots are a better organized method of handling
overlapping points than jittering. The following pair of plots
illustrate this idea.

<<geom-dotplot-ex3-bw,echo=bw_version,eval=bw_version,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(vs), y = mpg)) +
   theme_bw() + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(vs)),
                             alpha = 0.3, outlier.color = NA) +
   geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.05),
              colour = "blue", fill = "blue") +
   labs(x = "vs", y = "mpg", fill = "vs") +
   scale_fill_grey(start = 0.6, end = 0.8)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(vs), y = mpg)) +
   theme_bw() + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(vs)),
                         alpha = 0.3, outlier.color = NA) +
   geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",
          position = "dodge", colour = "blue", fill = "blue") +
   labs(x = "vs", y = "mpg", fill = "vs") +
   scale_fill_grey(start = 0.6, end = 0.8)
@
<<geom-dotplot-ex3-col,echo=!bw_version,eval=!bw_version,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(vs), y = mpg)) +
   geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(vs)), alpha = 0.3, outlier.color = NA) +
   geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.05),
              colour = "blue", fill = "blue") +
   labs(x = "vs", y = "mpg", fill = "vs")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(vs), y = mpg)) +
   geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(vs)), alpha = 0.3, outlier.color = NA) +
   geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",
                position = "dodge", colour = "blue", fill = "blue") +
   labs(x = "vs", y = "mpg", fill = "vs")
@

Whenever a factor is used as an aesthetic
in a dot plot, the rule is that the dot plot for each level will be
dodged; this is also the case when multiple factors are at play.
For example, if $A$ and $B$ are two factors such that
the levels of $A$ map to the horizontal axis, then dotplots
of each level of $B$ are dodged within individual levels of $A$. The
following plot shows two different ways of handling this
situation. The left plot dodges the dot plots by number of cylinders
within each level of \code{vs}, whereas the right plot uses
\func{facet\_grid} as an alternative mode of display. In this
particular example, the faceted plot makes it easier to see that there
are no cars with eight cylinders when \code{vs = 1}. Note that in
the faceted plot, the labeller function \func{label\_both} is used to
indicate both the factor name and its level in each panel strip.

<<geom-dotplot-ex4-bw,echo=bw_version,eval=bw_version,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.48\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(vs), fill = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  theme_bw() + geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",
                            position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "vs", y = "mpg", fill = "cyl") +
  scale_fill_grey(start = 0.2, end = 0.9) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), fill = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  theme_bw() + geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center") +
  labs(x = "No. cylinders", y = "mpg", fill = "cyl") +
  facet_grid(. ~ vs, labeller = label_both) +
  scale_fill_grey(start = 0.2, end = 0.9) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
@
<<geom-dotplot-ex4-col,echo=!bw_version,eval=!bw_version,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.48\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=

  facet_grid(. ~ vs, labeller = label_both) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
@

\subsection{\func{geom\_violin}}

This function generates violin plots in \pkg{ggplot2}, a way to plot
one or more continuous density estimates that is particularly useful
when comparing multiple groups. A violin plot is a combination of a
box plot and a kernel density estimate, the latter of which is rotated
to run alongside the box plot symmetrically on each
side. The examples below come from the function's help page.

In \func{geom\_violin}, violins are automatically dodged when any
aesthetic is a factor. By default, the maximum width is scaled to be
proportional to the sample size. In the plot on the far right below,
the bandwidth of the kernel density estimator is reduced from the
default 1, which makes for a less smooth density estimate and hence a
less smooth violin plot.

<<geom-violin-ex1-bw,eval=bw_version,echo=bw_version,fig.width=3,fig.height=2.5,out.width='0.31\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg))
p + geom_violin()    # default scale is "count"
p + geom_violin(aes(fill = factor(cyl), colour = factor(cyl))) +
    scale_fill_grey(start = 0.2, end = 0.8) +
    scale_colour_grey(start = 0.2, end = 0.8)
p + geom_violin(adjust = 0.5)
@
<<geom-violin-ex1-col,eval=!bw_version,echo=!bw_version,fig.width=3,fig.height=2.5,out.width='0.31\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg))
p + geom_violin()    # default scale is "count"
p + geom_violin(aes(fill = factor(cyl), colour = factor(cyl)))
p + geom_violin(adjust = 0.5)
@

The next set of plots simply play around with a few extra features.
The plot on the left adds a strip plot to the violin for each group.
The central plot adds fill color and alpha transparency to the violins
and is augmented with boxplots. The plot on the far right adds
a dot plot around the center of each violin, which is useful in that
the dot plot resembles the shape of the violin (as it should since
each estimates the underlying true density in its own way).

<<geom-violin-ex22-bw,eval=bw_version,echo=bw_version,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,out.width='0.31\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
set.seed(110)

\section{New annotation functions}
\label{sec:annotation}

Version 0.9.0 debuts three new functions for annotation of graphics:
\func{annotation\_raster}, \func{annotation\_map} and
\func{annotation\_custom}. These can be used to decorate a \code{ggplot}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \func{annotation\_raster} allows one to insert a (raster) image
    into a plot. It can serve as a plot background (see the example
    below) or be a graphical object positioned somewhere in the
    graphics area of a \code{ggplot}.
  \item \func{annotation\_map} allows one to insert a map inside of a
    graphics region, \eg as an inset.
  \item \func{annotation\_custom} allows one to insert graphs,
    tables or other graphical objects of value in a graphic.
\end{itemize}

The first example is a modification of the
example in \func{annotation\_raster} to combine all
three new annotation functions in one graphic.
<<baptiste-example,fig.width=5,fig.height=5>>=
p <- qplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars) + theme_bw()
## color gradient
rainbow <- t(hcl(seq(0, 360, length = 300 * 50), 80, 70))
## scaled down map of NZ
nz <- transform(map_data("nz"), long = scale(long) + 15,
               lat = scale(lat)/5 + 2)
# Inset plot
g <- ggplotGrob(p)
# Put it together:
p + annotation_raster(rainbow, -Inf, Inf, -Inf, Inf) +
    geom_point() +
    annotation_map(nz, fill = "NA", colour = "grey50") +
    annotation_custom(grob = g, xmin = 25, xmax = 35,
                      ymin = 3.5, ymax = 5)
@

The next example inserts a table and a picture in the graphic using
the \code{InsectSprays} data. The
table is produced from the \func{tableGrob} function in the
\pkg{gridExtra} package.
<<annotation-example,fig.width=5,fig.height=5>>=
ISsumm <- ddply(InsectSprays, .(spray), summarise,
                mean = mean(count), sd = sd(count))
tb <- tableGrob(ISsumm, rows = ISsumm$spray, show.rownames = FALSE,
                gpar.corefill = gpar(fill = "white"))
if (!file.exists("hadley.jpg"))
  download.file("http://had.co.nz/me.jpg", "hadley.jpg", mode = "wb")
hadley <- readJPEG("hadley.jpg")
ggplot(ISsumm, aes(x = spray, y = mean)) +
    geom_boxplot(data = InsectSprays, aes(y = count),
                 fill = "blue", alpha = 0.2,
                 size = 0.7, outlier.colour = NA) +
    geom_point(data = InsectSprays, aes(y = count), size = 2.5,
               position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)) +
    ylim(0, 40) + labs(x = "Spray", y = "Insect count") +
    annotation_custom(grob = tb, xmin = 0.5, xmax = 3.5,
                                 ymin = 25, ymax = 40) +
    annotation_raster(hadley, xmin = 5.5, xmax = 6.5,
                              ymin = 30, ymax = 40)
@
\noindent Note that the \func{readJPEG} function comes from the
\pkg{jpeg} package, designed to read JPEG files.

If you resize a \code{ggplot} graphic in a document with decorations
such as those shown in the previous two examples, there is no guarantee that
the decorations will scale in the same ratio as the rest of the
graphic. Maps and rasters will scale proportionally with the plot, but
custom grobs may not scale at all, such as the \code{tableGrob}
produced in the graphic above. When adding
annotations to a graphic that will end up in a document, it may be a good idea
to create a graphics window in \R\ of the same size as what you want
in the document. By developing the graphic at that size,
you should have more confidence that what you see in \R\ is what
you'll see in the document.

Another aspect of annotations in \pkg{ggplot2} is that they are
displayed in each facet because they are insensitive to
mapping. Here's a simple example:
<<facets-with-raster,fig.width=3.5,fig.height=3.5>>=
DF <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y1 = rnorm(10), y2 = rnorm(10))
# Read in the R logo:
Rlogo <- readJPEG(file.path(R.home("doc"), "html", "logo.jpg"))
# Melt and plot:
dfm <- melt(DF, id = "x")
ggplot(dfm, aes(x = x, y = value)) + geom_path() +
    ylim(-3, 3) + theme_bw() +
    annotation_raster(Rlogo, xmin= 7.6, xmax = 10,
                             ymin = 2, ymax = 3) +
    facet_wrap(~ variable)

\section{Improvements in \func{facet\_grid}}
\label{sec:facetgrid}

Several improvements have been made to \func{facet\_grid}, as noted in
the NEWS file for this version of the package and in
section~\ref{sec:vischg}. Below are some examples taken from the
function's help page.

The first plot illustrates a one-dimensional grid with free scales---the
x scales vary and the panel widths are the same:
<<'facet-grid-example-1d',fig.width=5,fig.height=3>>=
m <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt, colour = factor(cyl))) + geom_point()
m + facet_grid(. ~ cyl, scales = "free") + labs(colour = "cyl")
@

Next, we show a set of plots with two-dimensional grids. The first is
a basic 2D grid with free scales in both dimensions---in this case,
each panel has separate $x$ and $y$ scales. The plot on the right
shows that \code{margins = TRUE} is once again a viable option in
\func{facet\_grid}.
<<'facet-grid-2d-example1',fig.width=4,fig.height=3.5,out.width='0.48\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
m + facet_grid(vs ~ am, scales = "free") + labs(colour = "cyl") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
m + facet_grid(vs ~ am, margins = TRUE) + labs(colour = "cyl") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
@
One of the new features, due to the efforts of Willem Ligtenberg, is
to allow free scales in one direction only. The left plot below produces
different $x$ scales in the columns while the plot on the right
produces different $y$ scales:
<<'facet-grid-2d-example2',fig.width=4,fig.height=4,out.width='0.48\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
m + facet_grid(vs ~ am, scales = "free_x") + labs(colour = "cyl") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
# Add labeller to distinguish levels of vs
# from those of am:
m + facet_grid(vs ~ am, scales = "free_y", labeller = label_both) +
    labs(colour = "cyl") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
@

%\newpage

\noindent The following plots, which are not shown here, combine free
scales with free space:
<<facet-grid-freespaceandscales,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
m + facet_grid(vs ~ am, scales = "free", space = "free")
m + facet_grid(vs ~ am, scales = "free", space = "free_x")
m + facet_grid(vs ~ am, scales = "free", space = "free_y")
@

The way strip labels are rendered in \func{facet\_grid} has changed in version
0.9.0. One now uses the \func{label\_*} functions from the
\pkg{scales} package in conjunction with the \code{labeller =}
argument of \func{facet\_grid}. A couple of examples using the
\func{label\_both} were shown above; the default labeller is
\func{label\_value}. The following example from the \func{facet\_grid}
help page in 0.9.0 demonstrates the other built-in labeling functions:
<<facet-grid-label-ex,fig.width=4,fig.height=4,out.width='0.48\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
mtcars$cyl2 <- factor(mtcars$cyl, labels = c("alpha", "beta", "sqrt(x, y)"))
q <- qplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars) + facet_grid(cyl ~ vs)
# Recall that the levels of vs are 0 and 1:
q + facet_grid(. ~ vs, labeller = label_bquote(alpha^.(x)))
q + facet_grid(. ~ cyl2, labeller = label_parsed)
@
The labeller function \func{label\_bquote} takes a `bquoted'
expression as its input argument. In previous versions of
\pkg{ggplot2}, one would define a function and then pass it to the
\code{labeller = } argument. With \func{label\_parsed}, one passes a
vector of strings to \func{facet\_grid} that are parsed into
expressions and evaluated.

\section{\pkg{scales} package}
\label{sec:scalespkg}

The first phase of reorganizing the \pkg{ggplot2} package was to group
functions that pertain to the construction of guides---\ie axes (or
positional guides) and legends (aesthetic guides)---into a single
package. These functions are derived from \pkg{ggplot2-0.8.9}
but have been rewritten so that they can be used in base graphics or
\pkg{lattice}\footnote{Tangible evidence of this feature is shown
in the examples of the \func{cscale} and \func{dscale} functions in
\pkg{scales}.}.

\noindent The functions in the \pkg{scales} package fall broadly into
the following categories:
\begin{description}
  \item[*\_breaks():] functions to manipulate axis breaks;
  \item[*\_format():] functions that are used to modify axis labels,
  replacing the \code{formatter = } argument of a positional scale
  function in previous versions of \pkg{ggplot2};
  \item[label\_*():] functions to modify panel strips in faceted ggplots;
  \item[*\_trans():] a collection of predefined scale transformation
    functions and their inverses, to be used with the new \code{trans
      = } argument to positional scale functions;
  \item[*\_pal():] a set of functions that correspond to attributes
    associated with legends.
\end{description}

The \func{scale\_*} functions have been rewritten so that both the
\texttt{breaks} and
\texttt{labels} arguments accept a function as its `value'. A
new argument \code{trans} allows one to specify a scale
transformation in \func{scale\_continuous} or \func{scale\_discrete};
this new argument streamlines the number of continuous axis scaling
functions in 0.9.0---the only ones that remain are
\func{scale\_continuous}, \func{scale\_discrete},
\func{scale\_reverse}, \func{scale\_sqrt} and \func{scale\_log10}.

An important characteristic of the functions in the \pkg{scales}
package is that they are \textbf{second-order R functions}. This means
a given function, \eg \func{comma\_format}, returns a \emph{function},
so it needs two sets of arguments to be evaluated. To illustrate,
\func{comma\_format} has an argument \code{digits} which can be used
to avoid potential ugliness in axis breaks:
<<comma-format-ex>>=
# Call with default digits argument
comma_format()(seq(0, 10000, by = 2000))
# Set digits = number of digits in the maximum value among the axis breaks
comma_format(digits = 5)(seq(0, 10000, by = 2000))
# Don't forget there are two sets of arguments:
comma_format(seq(0, 10000, by = 1000))
@
The first set of arguments in a second-order \R\ function correspond
to those you want to change in the original function; the second set
of arguments call the function returned by the original function.

The purpose of converting to functions and repackaging them
is to provide a user with more tools to
manage axis ticks, axis labels and certain elements of legends.
Except for the \func{*\_pal} functions, these will normally be used
inside a \func{scale\_*} function call; several examples are given in
section~\ref{sec:axes}.

\newpage
\subsection{Functions to manage breaks, axis labels and strip labels}
\label{sec:breaks}

\noindent The following table summarizes the set of functions
associated with axis breaks, axis labels and strip labels (in faceted ggplots):
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \textbf{Breaks}   &  \textbf{Formats}   & \textbf{Labels} \\ \hline
  \func{date\_breaks} & \func{comma\_format} & \func{label\_both} \\
  \func{log\_breaks}  & \func{dollar\_format} & \func{label\_bquote} \\
  \func{pretty\_breaks} & \func{percent\_format} & \func{label\_parsed} \\
  \func{trans\_breaks} & \func{scientific\_format} & \func{label\_value} \\
                       & \func{date\_format} &    \\
                       & \func{parse\_format} &   \\
                       & \func{math\_format}  &   \\
                       & \func{format\_format} &  \\
                       & \func{trans\_format}  &  \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Just as one could write a formatter function in previous versions of
\pkg{ggplot2}, one can define a function inside \func{math\_format} to
pass as the \code{labels = } argument of the
appropriate scale function.

\subsection{Transformation functions}
\label{sec:trans}

The table below summarizes the available transformation functions in
the \pkg{scales} package to be used in conjunction with the
\func{coord\_trans} function or the \code{trans = }
argument in a positional scale function.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \func{asn\_trans}  &  \func{identity\_trans}  &  \func{probit\_trans} \\
    \func{atanh\_trans} & \func{log1p\_trans} & \func{reciprocal\_trans} \\
    \func{boxcox\_trans} & \func{log\_trans}  & \func{reverse\_trans}  \\
    \func{date\_trans}  & \func{logit\_trans} & \func{sqrt\_trans}  \\
    \func{exp\_trans}  & \func{probability\_trans} & \func{time\_trans}
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Nearly all of these functions derive from \pkg{ggplot2},
rewritten to have a consistent format so that it will
be easier for users to define their own transformation functions. The
simplest pattern for a transformation function is
<<mytrans,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
my_trans <- function()
   trans_new("my", function(x) ..., function(x) ...)
@
\noindent where the first argument is the name of the transformation, the second
argument is the function corresponding to the transformation and the
third argument is its inverse function. The ellipses are placeholders
for the function definitions. Two examples are illustrated
below: the arcsine transformation and the slightly more complicated
logarithmic transformation:
<<arcsine>>=
asn_trans
log_trans
@

\subsection{Palette functions}
\label{sec:pal}

This set of functions in the \pkg{scales} package is primarily for use
with scale functions corresponding to plot attributes such as color,
hue, linetype or character shape. The palette functions are summarized
in the table below:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  \textbf{Color and fill}  & \textbf{Other aesthetics}  \\ \hline
  \func{brewer\_pal}   & \func{area\_pal}  \\
  \func{dichromat\_pal} & \func{identity\_pal}  \\
  \func{div\_gradient\_pal} & \func{linetype\_pal}  \\
  \func{grey\_pal}  & \func{rescale\_pal}  \\
  \func{hue\_pal}  & \func{shape\_pal}  \\
  \func{seq\_gradient\_pal}  &    \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Most of the time there is no need to use these functions with
\pkg{ggplot2} graphics since the package already has built-in
functions that incorporate these palettes. More often, one would use
them in conjunction with the \func{cscale} and \func{dscale} functions
in the \pkg{scales} package using base or Lattice graphics.

\section{Scaling x- and y-axes}
\label{sec:axes}

Axes are positional guides that contain a \emph{scale}, a
\emph{label}, a \emph{rule} and usually, a \emph{title}. The
fundamental difference between axes and legends is that axes are
transformable whereas legends are not (Wilkinson, 2005). As a result,
the \func{scale\_continuous} and \func{scale\_discrete} functions in
\pkg{ggplot2} now take a \code{trans = } argument, but scale functions
for legends (\eg, \func{scale\_colour\_*} or \func{scale\_linetype})
do not. Conversely, scale functions for legends have a \code{guides =
} argument (see section \ref{sec:guides}) that positional axis
functions do not.

The \code{trans = } argument in a discrete or continuous scale
function corresponds to the scale transformation to be applied to the
variable of interest prior to any statistical transformation. The
examples in this section coordinate the new features of the
\func{scale\_*} functions with the functions in the \pkg{scales}
package described in section~\ref{sec:scalespkg}.

The \func{*\_breaks} set of functions
controls the values that define the rule, which may be formatted by one
of the \func{*\_format} functions introduced in
section~\ref{sec:breaks} to produce the labels. In fact, you can think
of the \code{labels} argument in 0.9.0 \func{scale\_*} functions as
a merger of the \code{labels} and \code{formatter} arguments from
previous versions. For dates
and/or times, one can use the \func{scale\_date} or
\func{scale\_datetime} functions, which also allow the \code{breaks = }
and \code{labels = } arguments to take functions as `values'. The most
common applications for \code{\_breaks} functions are (i) specification of
date intervals and (ii) breaks for a log scale of arbitrary base. This
section is divided into two parts: (a) date and datetime scales
and (b) continuous scales.

\subsection{Dates and datetimes}
\label{sec:date-examples}

Some \pkg{ggplot2} users have found date formatting to be rather
vexing in the past, so now there are two functions in the \pkg{scales} package
that should make it easier to specify date formats. The
\func{date\_breaks} function defines the time interval between adjacent
breaks while the \func{date\_format} function specifies how the dates
should be displayed on the time axis. The syntax
for individual date elements such as years, days and months is
described in \code{?strptime}. The following example comes from the
\code{economics} data frame in \pkg{ggplot2} where we use
\func{date\_breaks} and \func{date\_format} to tailor the date
axis. The plot on
the left is the default plot whereas the one on the right modifies the
date breaks and labels as well as expressing the response as a percentage:
<<date-breaks-labels-ex1,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
(qp <- qplot(date, psavert, data = economics, geom = "line") +
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Personal savings rate"))
# Divide savings rate by 100 to get the correct percentages
qplot(date, psavert/100, data = economics, geom = "line") +
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Personal savings rate") +
    scale_x_date(breaks = date_breaks("5 years"),
                 labels = date_format("%Y")) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
@
\noindent Notice that since \func{percent\_format} has no arguments,
we can simply use the kernel of the function name as the argument of
\code{labels = } in \func{scale\_y\_continuous}.

\noindent As a side note, the equivalent code in version 0.8.9 for the
plot on the right would be
<<date-breaks-labels-ex1old,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
qplot(date, psavert/100, data = economics, geom = "line") +
     labs(x = "Year", y = "Personal savings rate") +
     scale_x_date(major = "5 years") +
     scale_y_continuous(formatter = "percent")
@


%\noindent The next plot uses both major and minor axis breaks:
%<<date-breaks-ex2,fig.width=5,fig.height=2.3,message=FALSE,cache=TRUE>>=
%# qp + scale_x_date(major = "10 years", minor = "5 years")
%qp + scale_x_date(breaks = date_breaks("10 years"),
%                 minor_breaks = date_breaks("5 years"),
%                 labels = date_format("%Y"))
%@

\noindent Next, consider an example with datetime data. A
small fake data frame is constructed to produce a couple of plots
using datetime axes.
<<datetime-breaks-ex5a,fig.width=5,fig.height=2>>=
df2 <- data.frame(times = seq(as.POSIXct("2011-10-20 00:00:00"),
                              as.POSIXct("2011-10-20 23:59:59"),
                               by = "30 min"), y = rnorm(48))
# 0.8.9 code:
# ggplot(df2, aes(x = times, y = y)) + geom_path() +
#     scale_x_datetime(major = "4 hours", format = "%H:%M:%S")
# 0.9.0 code:
# Labels with times only:
ggplot(df2, aes(x = times, y = y)) + geom_path() +
      scale_x_datetime(breaks = date_breaks("4 hours"),
                       labels = date_format("%H:%M:%S"))
@
<<datetime-breaks-ex5b,fig.width=5,fig.height=2>>=
# Labels with both day and time:
last_plot() + scale_x_datetime(breaks = date_breaks("6 hours"),
                               labels = date_format("%b %d\n%H:%M:%S"))
@
From these examples, one can see that the \func{date\_breaks} function
replaces the deprecated argument \code{major = } in \func{scale\_date\_x} and
that \func{date\_format} replaces the old argument \code{format = }.

\subsection{Continuous variables}

Several important changes have been made to the arguments of
\func{scale\_continuous} which will be illustrated in this subsection.
Consider the problem of finding a histogram for a lognormal
pseudo-random sample, where the
histogram is the `statistical transformation' of interest.

The left graph below is a histogram in the original scale of
measurement while its counterpart on the right is computed from the
natural logarithm of the original measurements.
<<lognormal-ex1,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5,out.width='.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
DF <- data.frame(x = rlnorm(1000, m = 10, sd = 5))
# on original scale, produces a spiked histogram
(p <- ggplot(DF, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram())
# Apply a scale transformation to x to get the histogram of ln(x):
p + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log")
@
\noindent The right side graph would have been called with the
following code in 0.8.9, with very different axis labels:
<<lognormal-ex1a,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE>>=
p + scale_x_log()
@

Let's suppose we want to label the horizontal axis so that the labels
are of the form $e^x$, where $x$ is an integer, similar to what one
gets from the 0.8.9 version. The simplest approach is to transform $x$
in the \func{ggplot} call
and use \func{math\_format} to get the desired labels. The token
\code{.x} is a placeholder for the value within \func{math\_format},
to which the breaks defined in the \func{qplot} call are (implicitly) passed.
<<logtransform-histogram,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.6>>=
q <- ggplot(DF, aes(x = log(x))) + geom_histogram()
q + scale_x_continuous(labels = math_format(e^.x)) + xlab("x")
@

\noindent The more formal way to do this, starting from the original histogram
\code{p}, involves use of the \code{trans = } argument with
corresponding breaks and labels functions:
<<breaks-after-transform-ex2,eval=FALSE>>=
p + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log",
                       breaks = trans_breaks("log", "exp"),
                       labels = trans_format("log", math_format(e^.x)))
@
In this call, a (natural) log transformation is applied to the
data using the \code{trans = } argument of \func{scale\_x\_continuous},
the \func{trans\_breaks} function generates `pretty' breaks in the log
scale and \func{trans\_format} uses those breaks to produce the labels
using the format given in \func{math\_format}. If you try
the above call without \func{math\_format}, it will provide pretty
linear breaks in the log scale by default, which is a sensible scaling
\emph{in natural log units}.

Here's a similar example that was discussed on the ggplot2 list
recently, using the diamonds data with the \func{scale\_x\_log10} function:
<<diamonds-log10trans-labeling,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8,out.width='.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
dsmall <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
## default x-axis log scaling
qplot(carat, price, data = dsmall, alpha = I(0.2)) +
   scale_x_log10() +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar)
## log-linear x-scaling with labels from math_format()
qplot(carat, price, data = dsmall, alpha = I(0.2)) +
   scale_x_log10(breaks = trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 10^x),
                 labels = trans_format("log10", math_format(10^.x))) +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar)
@
\noindent Observe that the inverse function of
$\log_{10}$ is defined as a function in \func{trans\_breaks}.

There is a compelling argument to be made that the breaks in
the left plot are more indicative of the original carat values when
the plot is rendered in the $\log_{10}$ scale. The default choice of
breaks clearly indicates that the variable on the horizontal axis has
been transformed.

To define your own scale functions, you will likely need to use
\func{trans\_breaks} and \func{trans\_format} in some way or
another. Here is an example using the \code{msleep} data from
\pkg{MASS}, where both brain weight and body weight require a
$\log_{10}$ transformation. Suppose you want the 0.8.9 behavior in both
positional axis; here's one way to do it.
<<loglogscale,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5,out.width='.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
# Define 'old style' behavior for log10 axes
scale_x_log10old <- function(...) {
     scale_x_log10(breaks = trans_breaks('log10', function(x) 10^x),
            labels = trans_format('log10', math_format(10^.x)), ...)
    }
scale_y_log10old <- function(...) {
     scale_y_log10(breaks = trans_breaks('log10', function(x) 10^x),
            labels = trans_format('log10', math_format(10^.x)), ...)
    }
# standard 0.9.0 plot on a log10-log10 scale
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = bodywt, y = brainwt)) + geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()
# old style axis labeling
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = bodywt, y = brainwt)) + geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10old() + scale_y_log10old()
@

Another example comes from the ggplot2 list, where someone wanted a
`negative log 10' y-scale. Here are a couple of alternatives to choose
from; there are certainly others.
<<neglog10ex,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5,out.width='.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
# Define the negative log 10 function
neglog10 <- function(x) -log10(x)
# Reverse scaling (zero on top)
scale_y_revneglog10 <- function(...) {
   scale_y_reverse(
     breaks = trans_breaks('neglog10', function(x) 10^(-x)),
     labels = trans_format('neglog10', math_format(10^-.x)), ...)
    }
# Standard negative log 10 scale
scale_y_neglog10 <- function(...) {
   scale_y_log10(
     breaks = trans_breaks('neglog10', function(x) 10^(-x)),
     labels = trans_format('neglog10', math_format(10^-.x)), ...)
    }
# Example:
DF <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 10^-(1:10))
ggplot(DF, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() + scale_y_revneglog10()
ggplot(DF, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() + scale_y_neglog10()
@

The final example in this subsection illustrates a couple more uses of
the \func{math\_format} function to place mathematical expressions in
axis labels.
<<axis-labels-math1,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
d <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
## Math notation in labels
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10, labels = math_format(alpha + .x))
## Define a vector of breaks manually:
lb <- seq(1, 9, by = 2)
last_plot() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = lb, labels = math_format(beta^.x))
@
In both cases, the second set of arguments of \func{math\_format} are
implicit from the defined set of breaks. An expression is passed as
the argument to \func{math\_format}, which returns a function with
argument \code{.x}. The function call takes the defined breaks as
input to create the labels. We could also have called
\func{math\_format} with two explicit sets of arguments as follows:
<<axis-labels-math1b,eval=FALSE>>=
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10,
                     labels = math_format(alpha + .x)(1:10))
last_plot() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = lb,
                                 labels = math_format(beta^.x)(lb))

\subsection{Scale and coordinate transformations}

The distinction between scale and coordinate transformations is that
scale transformations take place \emph{before} any
statistics are computed, whereas coordinate transformations take place
\emph{afterward}. In the example below, there is no difference in appearance
between apposing pairs of plot calls because no statistical
transformation takes place. However, when summary geoms are plotted
(\eg \func{geom\_histogram} or \func{geom\_density}), there will often be a
difference in appearance depending on when the transformation is applied.
<<proportions-plot,fig.width=3.2,fig.height=2>>=
# y is a vector of proportions
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = round(runif(10), 3))
qplot(x, y, data = df1)
@
\noindent Two ways of plotting the $\sin^{-1}$ transformation of y:
<<arcsin-trans,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8,out.width='.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
qplot(x, y, data = df1) + scale_y_continuous(trans = "asn")
qplot(x, y, data = df1) + coord_trans(ytrans = "asn")
@

The lognormal example from the previous section shows this game
doesn't always work. Run this code in an \R\ session---the second plot
call throws an error:
<<lognorm-trans,eval=FALSE>>=
p + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log")
p + coord_trans(xtrans = "log")
@
\noindent In other words, one needs to exercise some care when using scale
transformations as opposed to coordinate transformations when
statistical transforms of the data are involved.

Here is an example from the \func{coord\_trans} help page to
illustrate the difference between scale transformations prior to model
fitting and coordinate transformations after a model fit. This is one
type of graphic that could not be produced easily prior to version 0.9.0.
<<scale-trans-distinction,dev='png',fig.width=4,fig.height=2.8,out.width='0.45\\textwidth',fig.show='hold'>>=
d <- subset(diamonds, carat > 0.5)
## Scale transformation prior to model fitting
qplot(carat, price, data = d, log="xy", alpha = I(0.05)) +
   geom_smooth(method="lm", size = 1)
## Coordinate transformation after model fitting
qplot(carat, price, data = d, alpha = I(0.05)) +
   geom_smooth(method="lm", size = 1) +
   coord_trans(x = "log10", y = "log10")
@
In the first graph above, the $x$ and $y$ axes were both
log-transformed and then a linear model was fit in the transformed
scales. In the second graph, the linear model was fit to the original
data first and then the $x$ and $y$ axes were
log-transformed. Mathematically, the fitted linear model in the first
graph has the form $\widehat{\log y} = b_0 + b_1 \log x$, whereas the
fitted model in the second graph is $\log \hat{y} = \log(b_0 + b_1
x)$, which happens to be a transform-both-sides model (Carroll and
Ruppert, 1988) since the same coordinate transformation was applied to
both sides of the fitted model.

\noindent Separate transformations for $x$ and $y$ are also possible:
<<indep-trans,dev='png',fig.width=3.5,fig.height=2.5>>=
qplot(carat, price, data = d, alpha = I(0.05)) +
   geom_smooth(method="lm", size = 1) +
   coord_trans(x = "log10", y = "sqrt") +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(digits = 5))

\section{Summary}

Several new features in \pkg{ggplot2-0.9.0} have been introduced and
illustrated by example. We have seen that a useR now has more tools at
one's disposal with respect to producing legends and positional axis
scales, some nice new features and improvements have taken place in
\func{facet\_grid} and several new
geoms that extend the scope of graphics applications in the package
have been introduced with accompanying examples of their use. A
number of incremental improvements have been made both in design and
execution; many of these were described in section~\ref{sec:intro},
but a more complete list is found in the NEWS file of the package.

Thanks to members of the \code{ggplot2-dev} list for comments on
earlier drafts of this document. Notably, Baptiste Auguie suggested the section
on annotations and provided valuable guidance and examples, and
Winston Chang provided numerous insights and suggestions regarding
\func{geom\_dotplot} and \func{geom\_violin}.

The document was processed using the \pkg{knitr} package, developed by Yihui Xie
\url{http://yihui.name/knitr/}. Special thanks to Yihui for
patiently answering many elementary questions about the package.

\noindent The source code for this version is located at \newline
\url{https://github.com/djmurphy420/ggplot2-transition-guide} \newline
in the file \code{ggplot2-0.9.0.Rnw}. The README file has instructions
for processing the \code{.Rnw} file for color or black-and-white printing.

We hope that this guide is helpful as you move from 0.8.9 to 0.9.0 and
that the changes and new facilities of the package aid you in making
even better ggplots.
